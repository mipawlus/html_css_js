JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object

Declare JavaScript Variables

var ourName;

ourName = 7; var ourName = 7;

Write variable names in JavaScript in camelCase. In camelCase, multi-word variable names have the first word in lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is capitalized.

Operators

addition +

JavaScript uses the + symbol as addition operation when placed between two numbers.

myVar = 12 + 6; // assigned 18

Substraction - 

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6

Multiply *

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169

Divide

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

myVar = 16 / 2; // assigned 8

Increment a Number

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;

is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;

Decrement a Number

You can easily decrement or decrease a variable by one with the -- operator.

i--;

is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;

Decimal number = 5.4
